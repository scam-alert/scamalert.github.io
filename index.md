## Details

I put up this site to alert unsuspecting users from falling prey to the newest scammers that I have seen (and yes I got scammed too). Here's my story.

The broker I am mentioning here is "Lyudmyla Baranov". I think she's running scam or part of a larger scam.
Brokercheck Profile link - https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/6790824
Website - https://www.lyudmylabaranov.com/

I found her name in some youtube video comment (it should have been a red flag from there, but I have learned my lesson the hard way now)

When I googled her name, I found out she was a registered broker on finra brokercheck. I saw the same profile that I have linked above. It made me trust her.

It seemed like a professional website with her pictures and contact information. I began the conversation with email. I asked for consultation on trading strategies.
Email conversation was followed by phone calls. Her phone no - 646-693-2315

Then she said that currently she prefers crypto market to do trading and asked me to send funds in the form of Bitcoin (another red flag I missed).

She opened an account in my name on blockchain.com and asked me to login, change paswwords etc. And transfer the money to this account in my name on blockchain.com

I did not know that she had the ability to pull the funds from this blockchain.com account even after I changed password and secured the account.

On Aug 11th, 8:56pm EDT, I transferred 2.5 Bitcoins to the above mentioned blockchain.com account, worth about 30,000 at the time.

Next morning, I received emails telling me that I have an account on https://thirdeyeinvestment.io

Looking at that website, the returns it talked about seemed too good to be true, but google search on its name did not yield any negative reviews/opinions. So I decided to wait and watch.

At this time, Lyudmyla started to pitch me a NFP investment on the thirdeyeinvestment website that requires a $50,000 investment. She pressured me a lot to give additional 20k for moving my funds to NFP, claiming NFP investment has huge upside.

Now I began to doubt her intentions, because I had told her in our previous communications, how much I had saved, and she was asking for more money because she knew that I had more money. However I refused to give more money to her. Then she asked to give $1500 more because by the time she deposited my fund to thirdeyeinvestment account, the value of my 2.5 BTC had dropped to $28500.

I gave her a runaround, for abount a week, while I did more research on thirdeyeinvestment.

I found the following on thirdeyeinvestment -

the guy who is in that video, called as CEO of thirdeyeinvestment - https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-draper/

its twitter account - https://twitter.com/ThirdEyeinvest1

2 github accounts - https://github.com/Thirdeyeinvestmentgroup  and https://github.com/ThirdEyeinvestment

I messaged Dan draper on linkedin, but never got a response. I also messaged a bunch of the followers on twitter, but did not get any response either.

By this time, Lyudmyla stopped trading on the thirdeyeinvestment account, due to me not giving the remaining $1500.

I saw on thirdeyeinvestment, that I will have opportunity to withdraw profits on 09/07. Fearing that I should not loose $30,000 over $1500, I gave her $1500 more in the form of bitcoin.

On 09/07 thirdeyeinvestment showed me that I can withdraw profits, so I followed the process of withdrawal, they said it takes about 3 hours to process withdrawal.
But the funds never arrived. I contacted thirdeyeinvestment's support, but they simply closed their ticket. Its just a stupid site that is there to help the scammers. Then I contacted Lyudmyla, she said she will sort it out with thirdeyeinvestment, but it has been another week. I am now 100% certain that this is a scam.

Update 2020-10-28: They started reaching back to me trying to pull off an exit scam. They are showing a balance of about $85,721, remember my initial investment was about $30,000. So they have sent me an invoice of $8177.64, and asking me to pay this amount before they will release my funds. Why can't they deduct this from my account balance - because its a scam. They want to get more money for pretending to return my money.

Now I see another such broker pop up "Juliana Gunawan Lee", who also is on brokercheck. This person is very likely a scammer too.

## Lesson - If anyone is promising you something that is too good to be true, they are running a scam
