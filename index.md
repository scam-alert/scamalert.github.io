# Hello and welcome to Scam Alert

I put up this site to alert unsuspecting users from falling prey to the newest scammers that I have seen (and yes I got scammed too). Here's my story.

I watch a bunch of financial news videos on youtube, and one fine day I noticed someone mentioning a name in the comments. I should have known right there that this was a scam.

But greed overcame me, also I had debt. 

So I googled the name of the person "Lyudmyla baranov"

Well, what do I see, she's a registered broker on https://brokercheck.finra.org/ - that boosted my trust so much, I started to overlook the obvious.

I contacted he over the email given on her website. Had a initial phone call. In hindsight, that should have triggered another red flag to me. She spoke in thick russian accent, told me everything a greedy investor with a lot of money to loose would do.

She told me returns will be 20-30%, she will setup my account on her system, money will be held in my account, and I can copy trade based on her alerts.
Meanwhile I found out that her domain was registed with identity protection (another huge red flag imo). But, my greed was not letting me see anything. 

I signed a contract with her, send her my details, she didn't ask for SSN or bank account details in the contract, pretty smart move to keep me comfortable with the contract.

She asked me to invest a minimum of 5 figures. And the idiot that I am - I agreed.

She asked fund in the form of Bitcoin to be sent
